# Project 3 - Natural Language Processing

This project lets you use the Meaning Cloud Sentiment Analisys API to capture and analyse the text of given URL.  
To do so, you must create an account at https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/create-account and create an API Key.  
After that, access the .env-example file and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual key.  
Now just rename the file to .env and you are ready to run the project.

- `npm install`  

This will install all the necessary packages.

Now, to run the dev server script, type:
- `npm run build-dev`

To build the project, run:
- `npm run build-prod`

To start the server, run:
- `npm start`
